# KineticSphere

**KineticSphere** is an interactive 3D simulation built using **React Fiber** and **Three.js**, where a group of spheres collide and interact with a central kinetic force. This project demonstrates basic physics principles, collision detection, and user interaction in a web environment.


## Features
- **Realistic Collision**: Spheres collide with each other in real time.
- **Central Force**: All spheres are attracted to a central point, creating dynamic motion.
- **User Interaction**: Hovering over the spheres makes them scatter and temporarily break the force's influence.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Powered by **React Fiber** and **Three.js**, ensuring smooth performance even with complex visual interactions.
## Installation

To get this project running locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yousseffdil/gravity_JS.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd gravity_JS
```
3.Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
5.Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the project in action.

## Usage
Hover your mouse over the spheres to interact with them.
Watch how they scatter and then reassemble due to the central kinetic force.

## Technologies Used
React Fiber: For handling complex UI updates and optimizing the performance of the simulation.
Three.js: For rendering 3D graphics directly in the browser.
JavaScript: Core language used to build the project.
